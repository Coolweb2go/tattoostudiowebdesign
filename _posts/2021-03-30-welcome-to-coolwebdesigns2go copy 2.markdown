My name is Elle Gamboa and I create custom mobile responsive sites built for tattoo shops, piercing parlors
& individual artists. Los Angeles web development company offers web design, web development, SEO
services, and digital marketing for many small businesses worldwide. Building mobile friendly & fully
responsive search optimized websites for tattoo & piercing shops is one of my specialties.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
